# advlearning_algos

> Comparing classic Adversarial Learning algorithms.

> A collaborative repo for class project issued by Dr. Ray in CSDS 440: Machine Learning during Fall 2020 semester.

Since we have decided to migrate the collaboration to `GitHub` for better readability on texts/PDFs/images and potential useful features like *issues*. This repository will be mirrored with `csevcs` before the final deadline (12/04/2020).

To do the mirroring, simply follow:

```
your_work_dir $ git clone --bare https://github.com/choH/advlearning_algos.git
your_work_dir $ cd advlearning_algos.git
advlearning_algos $ git push --mirror https://csevcs.case.edu/git/2020_fall_440_advlearning
```

Note this maneuver will completely overwrite the repository on `csevcs` â€” which shouldn't be a big deal since all our developments are initiated here, but please be caution.
